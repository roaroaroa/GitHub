Humans more easily remember or learn items when they are studied a few times spaced over a long time span rather than repeatedly studied in a short span of time.

Using the latest research on the field of "spacing effect" we present you an app which helps you to take information from your short term memory to long term memory.
We have found this app to be most effective while learning new language and preparing for tests like SAT or GRE but the scope is limitless. We would be glad to hear from you on how you are using the app.
